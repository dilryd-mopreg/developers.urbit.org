The Urbit Foundation offers cohort classes to cover the [App
School](/guides/core/app-school) curriculum jointly.

App School focuses on how to build a backend Gall agent, then on connecting it
to a React-based front-end.  When you're done, you'll be able to produce and
distribute your own Urbit apps.

If you prefer to learn as part of a group with a hands-on instructor, regular
exercises and discussions, and a completion certification, then App School Live
will be a good fit for you.

By completing App School as a cohort student, you should be able to design and
implement basic user apps, produce minimal working example applications, and
contribute at the level of basic Urbit userspace bounties.

The next cohort for App School Live will begin the week of August 21st, 2023.
